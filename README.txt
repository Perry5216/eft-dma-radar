Recommended PC/Game Settings:

1. Disable your 'system page file' in Windows (this will prevent Game Mem locations from being 'paged to disk').

2. Enable AUTO RAM CLEANER / MIP STREAMING in Tarkov Settings (this should keep you from running out of Mem due to #1)


NOTE: This is undetected AS LONG AS YOUR DMA DEVICE HAS UNDETECTABLE FIRMWARE!
